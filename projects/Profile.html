        <h1>Hello, my name is Marshall Tuarekura</h1>
        <p>I'm 23 years and I was born in Rarotonga, Cook Islands and was raised in New Zealand with loving grandparents, 
        I attend elementary school for 7 years. In 2016 we came back home to live again on the Island Aitutaki, and attended 
        I High school for four years and passed NCEA level one and passed NCEA Level Two I served a service mission on my Island
        and became the first pioneer to serve, things I done during my mission was volunteering at primary school or elementary 
        school teching young students that strangled with their subjects of knowing how to use a computer and teaching the basics.</p>

        <p>My dream career is becoming an Airline Pilot because I can't stop thinking about airplanes. Sometimes I like to talk about if
        front of my bestfriend whos seem interested and sometimes if not because it can be really be boring of just talking about Aviation, 
        talking to other friends will be a &quot;laughing stock but I dont mind&quot;. What didn,t able to reach that potential goal was the money because 
        going to flight school is expensive, so I decieded to come to BYUH to study Information Technology to work in tech company to make some money
        to fullfill my goals. My favouite Hobbies are......</p>
